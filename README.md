# CEO Pay, Worker Pay, and the Cost of Living
# About the project
This project examines the gap between executive compensation and worker pay in the United States. Through interactive data visualizations, we explore how CEO-to-worker pay disparities vary across companies and economic sectors, how worker pay compares with inflation and cost of living, and how alternative distributions of executive compensation could affect employees.
Our primary audience is labor union representatives and other worker advocates. We want to make large financial differences easier to understand and provide evidence that can support conversations about fair compensation, workplace conditions, and the distribution of corporate wealth.
Questions we explore
The project focuses on five connected questions:
1. Has typical worker pay kept pace with inflation and the cost of living?
2. Which economic sectors have the largest CEO-to-worker pay gaps?
3. How would employees' compensation change if CEO bonuses or a portion of company profits were redistributed among workers?
4. How does CEO-to-worker pay disparity relate to workers' everyday spending on necessities such as housing, food, transportation, and healthcare?
5. How do individual companies compare with one another within and across sectors?
We initially considered studying whether CEO-to-worker pay ratios were related to labor-investment efficiency. However, existing research did not support the direction of our original claim, so we removed that question from the final focus of the project.
# Data sources
Our analysis draws on publicly available data from:
- Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) for consumer price inflation
- Economic Policy Institute for historical CEO-to-worker pay ratios and worker pay indices
- AFL-CIO Executive Paywatch for executive and worker compensation data
- AFL-CIO Company Pay Ratios for company-level pay comparisons
- U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings for detailed executive compensation and employee information
- Bureau of Economic Analysis for regional price parity and cost-of-living comparisons by state
- Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey for household spending patterns by income group
- A Kaggle company compensation dataset for additional company-level comparisons
# Important data limitations
The available datasets do not measure every aspect of the pay gap in exactly the same way. In particular:
- Companies define their own median employee, which can include part-time or non-U.S. workers.
- Some datasets report pay ratios but not CEO compensation in dollar amounts.
- Cost-of-living data is available by state and year, while company headquarters may not represent where most employees live.
- Household spending data for the highest income group is used as an estimate for executive spending patterns; it does not represent CEOs directly.
- Detailed executive compensation data is available for only a limited sample of companies.
We present these limitations alongside the visualizations so that viewers can interpret the comparisons appropriately.

Our design process, research questions, sketches, voting process, and design-review notes are documented in the project process book.
Project status
This repository contains the development work for our final project. The visualizations and analysis may continue to change as we clean the data, refine the designs, and incorporate feedback from our target audience.
